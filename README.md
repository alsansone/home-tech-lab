# 🏡 Home Tech Lab

Welcome to **home-tech-lab** — a personal home server landing page and project hub built and hosted by me on an Ubuntu-powered local server.

## 🌐 What's Inside

This project is a self-hosted landing page that links to mini web apps and tools running on my home server.

### 🖥 Landing Page
The root of the site (`/`) shows a modern techy homepage with links to personal projects.

### 📋 [Chores Tracker](/chores/)
A weekly household chore tracker that:
- Divides chores between occupants
- Displays current assignments
- Lets you mark chores as complete

> Future features will include rotating assignments, persistent state, and more!

### 🎮 [Retro Game Project](/retro-game/)
A placeholder for a future 8-bit style web game.
